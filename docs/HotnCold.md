## Gameplay

1. **Room Scanning**: Each player uses their Meta Quest 3 headset to scan their room. The advanced depth sensor maps out the space, creating an accurate virtual representation.

2. **Hiding the Object**: Players select a virtual object and hide it in their opponent's virtual room. It's a game of wits and strategy - where will you hide your object?
