## Welcome!

Hey there! Thanks for checking out our Navigator's Hackathon final submission.

Hot 'n Cold is a mixed reality project where we mix up WebXR with Mina's Zero Knowledge Blockchain. It has been awesome building this out, and only a hint at what is to come. You can find more about Mina and WebXR in the links below.

## Features

- **Hide and Seek, but Cooler**: Ever wanted to hide stuff in your friend's room without messing it up? Well, now you can. Hide an object in their virtual room and watch them find it.
- **User Management System (kinda)**: We've got this neat system where you can sign up, make friends, and invite them over for a virtual game, all thanks to [Clerk](https://clerk.com/). Not fully fleshed out (adding friends on a live link seems to bug out but that will get fixed).
- **Blockchain Magic with Mina**: We use Mina's blockchain to make sure the game is fair. No cheating by hiding objects in furniture!

## Sandbox Mode

Wanna just mess around? Jump into our sandbox mode. Play with a virtual ball, check out how cool WebXR is, and just have fun with the physics in your own space. Also for people that don't have anyone to play with.

## What's Next?

- **Making Things Smoother**: We're working on making everything look and feel nicer. A slick user interface is on the way!
- **More Sandbox Fun**: We're beefing up our sandbox so you can do even more cool stuff.
- **Mina and Threejs Integration**: Getting Mina and threesjs to work together seamlessly is our next big thing.
- **Sneaky Features Coming Up**: Soon, you won't know where your friend is until you're right next to them. Stay tuned!

## Wanna Try?

Go [here](https://hot-n-cold.vercel.app/) - again some features tend to break so please forgive us (done in about 3ish weeks). It will get better :)
