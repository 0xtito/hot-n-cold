# zkArcade

## Welcome!

Hey there! Thanks for checking out zkArcade, our project submission for the [Mina Navigators Program](https://minafoundation.notion.site/Mina-Navigators-Program-Information-e8d0490aa0e04c28b061887a8cc22f9a).

zkArcade is an online marketplace for games of incomplete information (also known as fog-of-war games) built on top of [Mina](https://minaprotocol.com/)'s zero knowledge technology. Mina blockchain uses zero knowledge proofs to create a private and secure infrastructure to run zero-knowledge applications or "zkApps".

The private nature of the Mina blockchain makes it possible to build games of incomplete information that don't rely on trust between the players, but instead use the power of zero knowledge proofs to enforce the rules of the game.

## Games

- ### [Hot 'n Cold](./docs/HotnCold.md): A Thrilling XR Hide-and-Seek Game

  Welcome to **Hot 'n Cold**, the latest [WebXR](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-samples/) sensation for the Meta Quest 3. Dive into a world where your room transforms into a virtual playground. Get ready to hide and seek like never before - in the dark, with a twist!

## Sandbox Mode

Wanna just mess around? Jump into our sandbox mode. Play with a virtual ball, check out how cool WebXR is, and just have fun with the physics in your own space. Also for people that don't have anyone to play with.

## What's Next?

- **Making Things Smoother**: We're working on making everything look and feel nicer. A slick user interface is on the way!
- **More Sandbox Fun**: We're beefing up our sandbox so you can do even more cool stuff.
- **More Games**: We're cooking up some new games that will blow your mind away! ðŸ¤¯
