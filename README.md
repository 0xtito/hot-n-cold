# zkArcade

## Welcome!

Hey there! Thanks for checking out zkArcade, our project submission for the [Mina Navigators Program](https://minafoundation.notion.site/Mina-Navigators-Program-Information-e8d0490aa0e04c28b061887a8cc22f9a).

zkArcade is a online marketplace for games of incomplete information (also known as fog-of-war games) built on top of [Mina](https://minaprotocol.com/)'s zero knowledge technology. Mina blockchain uses zero knowledge proofs to create a private and secure infrastructure to run zero-knowledge applications or "zkApps".

The private nature of the Mina blockchain makes it possible to build games of incomplete information that don't rely on trust between the players, but instead use the power of zero knowledge proofs to enforce the rules of the game.

## Hot 'n Cold

Hot 'n Cold is a [mixed reality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_reality#:~:text=Mixed%20reality%20(MR)%20is%20a,and%20interact%20in%20real%20time.) game where we mix up [WebXR](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr-samples/) technology with Mina's zero-knowledge proofs.


### Features

- **Hide and Seek, but Cooler**: Ever wanted to hide stuff in your friend's room while on the other side of the world? Well, now you can. Hide an object in their virtual room and compete to see who finds it first.
- **User Management System (kinda)**: We've got this neat system where you can sign up, make friends, and invite them over for a virtual game, all thanks to [Clerk](https://clerk.com/). Not fully fleshed out (adding friends on a live link seems to bug out but that will get fixed).
- **Blockchain Magic with Mina**: We use Mina's blockchain to make sure the game is fair. No cheating by hiding objects in furniture!

### Sandbox Mode

Wanna just mess around? Jump into our sandbox mode. Play with a virtual ball, check out how cool WebXR is, and just have fun with the physics in your own space. Also for people that don't have anyone to play with.

### What's Next?

- **Making Things Smoother**: We're working on making everything look and feel nicer. A slick user interface is on the way!
- **More Sandbox Fun**: We're beefing up our sandbox so you can do even more cool stuff.
- **Mina and Threejs Integration**: Getting Mina and threesjs to work together seamlessly is our next big thing.
- **Sneaky Features Coming Up**: Soon, you won't know where your friend is until you're right next to them. Stay tuned!

### Wanna Try?

Go [here](https://hot-n-cold.vercel.app/) - again some features tend to break so please forgive us (done in about 3ish weeks). It will get better :)
